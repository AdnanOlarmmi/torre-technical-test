# 📖 Technical Test for Torre's Software Engineering Position <a name="about-project"></a>

The project is a technical testing for a full-stack software engineering position at Torre. The test requires the candidate to build a page that lists the skills of any given user and, if time allows, allows for further exploration of those skills. The candidate is expected to demonstrate their skills and strengths in several areas, including familiarity and usage of languages and frameworks chosen, project structure and architecture, code readability and scalability, separation of concerns, quality and speed of the app, usability, UI/UX, and attention to detail. The test was completed within 24 hours and requires a deployed (live) version of the solution, a control version system (such as GitHub) to review the code, and a paragraph answering a question about what else the candidate could have done or improved if they had more time.

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

- A web browser to view output e.g [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
- An IDE e.g [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- `node` should be installed in your local machine, [node website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Install the `npm` package manager use this [to install both node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
- [A terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics).

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

```
  git clone https://github.com/AdnanOlarmmi/Climate-App.git
```

- Navigate to the location of the folder in your machine:

you@your-Pc-name:~$ cd torre-technical-test


### Install

To install all dependencies, run:

```
  npm install
```

### Usage

After Cloning this repo to your local machine.
To get it running on your default browser and local host, run:

In the project directory, you can run:

```
  npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Run build for production

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance: run

```
npm run build
```

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Ejection

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project run:

```
npm run eject
```

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
