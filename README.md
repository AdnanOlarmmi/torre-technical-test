# 📖 Technical Test for Torre's Software Engineering Position <a name="about-project"></a>

The project is a technical testing for a full-stack software engineering position at Torre. The test requires the candidate to build a page that lists the skills of any given user and, if time allows, allows for further exploration of those skills. The candidate is expected to demonstrate their skills and strengths in several areas, including familiarity and usage of languages and frameworks chosen, project structure and architecture, code readability and scalability, separation of concerns, quality and speed of the app, usability, UI/UX, and attention to detail. The test was completed within 24 hours and requires a deployed (live) version of the solution, a control version system (such as GitHub) to review the code, and a paragraph answering a question about what else the candidate could have done or improved if they had more time.
